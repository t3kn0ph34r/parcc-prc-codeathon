Feature: PRC-874 District Readiness - State Admin View
  As a State Admin,
  I want to be able to see the results of the structured readiness checks run by schools in a district in my state I
  so that I can understand if the schools are ready to run PARCC assessment tests.

#  Acceptance Criteria
#  Background
#    Given I am logged in as a state admin
#    And I am on my State Readiness page
#    When I click the District Name link
#    Then I see the District Readiness page that has:
#  Differences from District Readiness - District Admin View (PRC-706)
#  Manage schools
#  No Edit district name link
#  No Manage schools link with explanatory copy: â€“ add schools and request readiness checks
