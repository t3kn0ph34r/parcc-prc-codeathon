Feature: PRC-967 Search/Filter Bar: View the Digital Library Filters
  As a user,
  I want to be able to view the Digital Library filters,
  so that I can see the choices I have to refine the Gallery results.

#  Given that I am on Digital Library page
#  When I press the Filter icon/button
#  Scenario 1: Filter menu is closed and filters aren't selected
#    And the Filter Menu is closed
#    And there are no Filters selected
#    Then the Filter Menu opens
#    And I see the content of the Gallery move down to keep the same space between the Gallery and the bottom of the Filter menu
#    And the Filter menu item status display changes to Open.
#    And I see the Close button/link

    # This is tested in diglib_filter_selection - @prc-968
    #    And I see the following filters in the menu:
    #  Grade
    #  Pre-K	Kindergarten	1st Grade	2nd Grade	3rd Grade	4th Grade	5th Grade	6th Grade	7th Grade	8th Grade	9th Grade	10th Grade	11th Grade	12th Grade
    #  Subject
    #  Career and Technical Education	Educational Leadership	English Language Arts	English Language Development	History/Social Studies	Math
    #  Physical Education	Science	Special Needs Support	STEM	Visual and Performing Arts	World Languages
    #  Media
