Feature: PRC-840 District Readiness - Name Added
  As a District Admin, I want to be able to add my district name so I can set up my district readiness page.

#  Acceptance Criteria
#  Given that I am logged in as a District Admin
#  And I am on the Add District page
#  And my fields are valid
#  When I click the Submit button
  Then the district name is added to my state's State Readiness page (PRC-707)
#  And I see District Readiness page with:
#  Page header
#  <District Name> Readiness
#  Overview copy
#  Overview / instructional copy goes here (click on school name to see admin can add / edit school, request that readiness checks be run, view results of technology checks by school and export all test results data to csv).
#  Edit district name (link)
#  Manage schools (link) â€“ descriptive copy: add schools and request readiness checks

    Given I am logged in as a user with the "District Admin" role
