Feature: Admin UI: Content Tab (PRC-169)
  As a Content Contributor,
  I want to view the content posted to Digital Library,
  so that I can edit them later as needed.

  Scenario: TT2 (PRC-225) Content View Created
    Given users:
      | name     | mail                | pass     | field_first_name | field_last_name | status |  
      | Betty User | betty@example.com | xyz123   | Betty             | User            | 1      |
    And I am on the homepage
    When I fill in "E-mail" with "betty@example.com"
    And I fill in "Password" with "xyz123"
    And I press "Log in"
    And I am on the homepage
    Then the user "betty@example.com" should have a role of "Content Contributor"

    When I follow "Content" in the "header" region
    Then I should see the heading "PRC Website Content" in the "content" region
    And I should see the link "Add content" in the "content" region
    Given "Digital Library Content" nodes:
