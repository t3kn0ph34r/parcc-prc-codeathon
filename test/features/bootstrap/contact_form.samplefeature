Feature: Contact form
  As a site visitor
  I need to use the contact form
  So that I can ask questions and provide feedback

  Scenario: Submits feedback with all required fields
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow "Contact us"
      And I fill in "Your name" with "Test user @timestamp"
      And I fill in "Your e-mail address" with "visitor@example.com"
      And I fill in "Subject" with "Great new site"
      And I fill in "Message" with "I especially like you!"
      And I press "Send message"
    Then I should see "Your message has been sent."

  Scenario: Does not submit form without supplying all required fields
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow "Contact us"
      # And I fill in "Your name" with nothing
      And I fill in "Your e-mail address" with "visitor@example.com"
      And I fill in "Subject" with "Great new site"
      And I fill in "Message" with "I especially like you!"
      And I press "Send message"
    Then I should see "Your name field is required."
      And I should not see "Your message has been sent."
